# flight-delays-2015
This project analyzes flight delay patterns across major U.S. airports using a longitudinal dataset from 2015. Through a series of statistical models, including multilevel modeling with fixed and random effects, we investigate how various factors—such as the number of carriers, on-time flights, and time trends—impact flight delay minutes.
